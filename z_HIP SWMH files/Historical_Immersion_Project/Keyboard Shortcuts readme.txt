Arumba and Internal Tab Shortcuts (HIP fork)

This mod is a fork of Arumba’s original Keyboard Shortcuts + Interface Adjust
mod for vanilla CK2. It’s been incorporated into HIP with his permission and
our gratitude. The fork is maintained by IoannesBarbarus.

With thanks to its author Kamufen, the Internal Tab Shortcuts mod has also been
incorporated.

This module is redundant if Kamufen’s Bigger Interface for HIP mod is enabled.

USAGE:
See below for an updated version of Arumba’s readme explaining the various
keyboard shortcuts. Check the description of the Internal Tabs Shortcuts mod
for a list of its added shortcuts. Most of those shortcuts have been added to
vanilla since 2.4. But the mod is still necessary for these items:

z will 'cancel' or 'go to' on event windows (such as disband troops, or after a siege/battle has completed)
z will go to the previous holding in demesne
c Confirms diplomacy interactions, and will 'ok' event windows (such as disband troops)
v will create a new vassal from the holding screen of minor owned baronies
b will go to the next holding in demesne
s is bound to the 'split navy' button if you have a single navy selected
/ opens the find title interface

Interface Adjust:  Adjusts the character selection GUI so that it does not overlap with the character interface.

Keyboard Shortcuts:

z raises levy directly from any county you have control over
z also toggles siege interface while selecting a province or army in an enemy province.
z also sends units to the left side of an army or ship balancing screen, each press sends the bottom listed unit left.  press and hold for rapid rebalancing
z will 'cancel' or 'go to' on event windows (such as disband troops, or after a siege/battle has completed)
z will go to the previous holding in demesne

x dismisses the currently selected levy (army or ship), *capital* "x" will dismiss ALL selected levies or ships

c raises ships directly from any county you have control over
c assaults holdings when you have an army/county is selected that allows for assaulting
c Confirms diplomacy interactions, and will 'ok' event windows (such as disband troops)

v embarks the currently selected levy into a ship that is IN port in that province
v also selects all armies inside boats if a ship is selected
v also will close one army at a time while having multiple armies selected. The two previously mentioned shortcuts take priorty. This shortcut is ideal for raiding with multiple armies as a viking. (v selects armies, right click all onto a county, press v, right click onto another county, repeat.)
v will create a new vassal from the holding screen of minor owned baronies

If you have a single army/shipgroup the "b" key will open the new unit interface (ship/army rebalancing)
b also sends units to the right side of an army or ship balancing screen, each press sends the bottom listed unit right.  press and hold for rapid rebalancing
b will go to the next holding in demesne
b is also back button for the main interfaces

g merges selected levies or ships if you have multiple armies selected, so long as they are in the same zone or province (naturally.)

s is bound to the 'split army/navy' button if you have a single army or navy selected

l toggles looter status for pagan armies

, opens the ledger, and closes the ledger

. opens the find characters interface, and also closes it

/ opens the find title interface

To manually alter keybindings, download notepad++ from www.ninite.com and install
use notepad++ to 'search in files', select the mod folder as the directory
search for: Shortcut = "
(leave the quotations open)
this will pull up all the shortcuts listed in the mod files.
doubleclick on the bottom of the screen through each of the results until you see the "guiButtonType =	{" that looks like what you want.
you can alter or remove any of the options that say "shortcut = "x"" to your liking
There is some trial and error to this if you are not experienced with the layout of the game files.  Just play with it, you'll figure it out.
